.Dot. is a puzzle game where you simply have to connect the dots. As the levels increase, more mechanics are involved pushing your puzzle solving skills to the limit

### Backstory
This game was originally created in Early December 2019 for a hackathon built in around 8 hours to experiment with **PixiJS** and **Webpack**. After creating the game, I enjoyed the puzzle concept and refactored the entire codebase. Since then I have been continually adding levels and features such as a **Level Builder** and a **Daily Challenge**

### Demo
This game is currently hosted on github pages which can be accessed from [here](https://porrige51122.github.io/.Dot./).
